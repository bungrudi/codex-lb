## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Reset-confirmed limit warm-up

The system SHALL support an optional limit warm-up mechanism that is disabled by default. When enabled globally and for an account, background usage refresh MAY send one minimal upstream Responses request after it confirms that a selected quota window has moved from an exhausted sample to a newly available reset window.

Periodic account warm-up SHALL be controlled by separate periodic warm-up settings and SHALL NOT cause reset-confirmed limit warm-up to send traffic when limit warm-up itself is disabled.

#### Scenario: Warm-up is skipped unless reset is confirmed
- **GIVEN** limit warm-up is enabled globally and for an account
- **AND** the account's previous usage sample for a selected window was exhausted
- **WHEN** background usage refresh records a newer sample for that window with `used_percent < 100` and a later `reset_at`
- **THEN** the system sends at most one warm-up request for that account/window/reset tuple

#### Scenario: Warm-up is opt-in and safe by default
- **GIVEN** background usage refresh is preparing to evaluate limit warm-up candidates
- **WHEN** global limit warm-up is disabled
- **OR** the account is not opted in
- **THEN** background usage refresh MUST NOT send warm-up traffic

#### Scenario: Warm-up uses fresh opt-in state after usage refresh
- **GIVEN** an account was loaded before a background usage refresh cycle
- **AND** the account's limit warm-up opt-in changes while the refresh cycle is running
- **WHEN** the scheduler evaluates warm-up candidates after writing usage samples
- **THEN** the scheduler MUST evaluate the latest persisted opt-in value rather than the stale in-session account object

#### Scenario: Warm-up respects unsafe account states
- **WHEN** an account is paused, deactivated, rate-limited, quota-exceeded, or in an auth-refresh failure path
- **THEN** limit warm-up MUST NOT send traffic for that account

#### Scenario: Warm-up attempts are durable and deduplicated
- **WHEN** multiple refresh workers observe the same account/window/reset candidate
- **THEN** the database permits at most one persisted attempt for that tuple
- **AND** later refresh cycles skip that tuple after a prior attempt exists

#### Scenario: Periodic warm-up does not enable reset-confirmed limit warm-up
- **GIVEN** periodic account warm-up is enabled
- **AND** reset-confirmed limit warm-up is disabled
- **WHEN** background usage refresh records a reset-confirmed candidate
- **THEN** reset-confirmed limit warm-up does not send traffic for that candidate
